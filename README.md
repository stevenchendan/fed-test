# Carter FED Test
Code test for potential Carter front-end developers

## The challenge:
Use a heady combination of front-end technologies to produce the card grid layout in `/CardGrid.jpg` (don't forget to make it responsive). All the content for the cards is in a .json file - read from this to output your cards onto the page.

The JSON can be found here - http://prototype.carter-dev.net/fed-test/items.json

You can use a framework if you like but avoid plugins - no need to change your style, just code how you normally would.

If you have time, apply some nice hover style to the cards, whatever you like.

Comment where needed.

Feel free to ask questions.
